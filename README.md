# Challenge
The client’s task for UNL Solutions was to make a web-based platform which would be accessible from both desktop and mobile devices.  Organization’s owners should have been able to freely ask to register their organization and have a back office panel where they can manage their organizations. There also should have been a similar backoffice panel for admins where they can manage owners, public contents and global platform configurations.

# Our solution
In the process of building, our developers have created several user interfaces with special functionalities for each of them: public, organization, administrator. The platform admin can manage all public contents (pages, CMS) and system configurations all users, approve or reject the registration of new organizations / authorities, deny access to the system to some users and see for every organization its balance. While an organization owner can manage all organization data (activities, objectives, users, expenses) and visualize some useful statistic graphs or PDFs.

 Main features of the platform are:

reliable transaction
high-performance
reliable replication mechanisms
backoffice panels’ rich functionality

# Outcome
The platform has been developed on time and successfully launched.UNL Solution and Devinterface have continued their collaboration on a range of other projects.
